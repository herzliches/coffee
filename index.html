          Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the
          tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. Coffee is one of
          the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and
          tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. Though
          coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including
          espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly
          attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine,
          an alkaloid present in coffee

          The stimulating effects of coffee were discovered by a goat herder in
          Ethiopia who noticed that his goats were particularly alert after
          consuming berries from a coffee tree.
